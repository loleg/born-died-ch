# born/died/swiss/2011

Animated visualization of Swiss birth and death statistics using Web graphics.

This is a http://make.opendata.ch project that was presented at an Open Data hackathon in Geneva, Switzerland on 28.09.2012. I had been tinkering with the idea to do something with this kind of visualization for a few weeks. It was at the event that I looked at the available data sources and turned this into something useful. Or, at least, slightly amusing.
